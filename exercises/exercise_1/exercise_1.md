# First Python exercise on data types, variables and operations.

The first task is to calculate the power consumption of a vehicle
driving at a constant speed of 80 kilometers per hour.
The vehicle has a mass of 1500 kg, a drag coefficient of 0.31 and 
a cross-sectional area of 1.97 m². The rolling resistance coefficient 
is 0.015.

Following other assumptions are made:
- The vehicle drives on level ground at a constant velocity.
- It's windless and the temperature is 20°C.
- The powertrain efficiency is ideal and there is no wheelspin.
